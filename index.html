  <h1>Drawing Circles with <i>Sine</i> &amp; <em>Cosine</em>.</h1>

  <p>A little example of how <i>sine</i> and <em>cosine</em> combine to draw a circle.

  <p>The <i>blue</i> line shows a <i>sine</i> wave travelling along the x axis. For values of <i>i</i> between 0 and <abbr title="this is Tau, which = 2π">τ</abbr>, the wave starts from the bottom of the canvas before sweeping up to the top and then back down.

  <p>The <em>red</em> line shows how (for the same values of i, and when plotted on a vertical instead of a horizontal axis) a cosine wave does not start at the edge of the canvas, but instead starts in the middle, so it sweeps right then left, before return to the middle.

  <p>The <b>purple</b> line combines the <em>x</em> position of the <em>cosine wave</em>, with the <i>y</i> position of the <i>sine wave</i>, and thus naturally draws a circle.

  <p>Toggles are provided: 🆂 for sine wave, 🅲 for cosine wave, 🅴 for edges, 🅻 for lines, 🅿 for the purple circle path and 🅰 to animate.

  <p>This demo uses the HTML Canvas, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
